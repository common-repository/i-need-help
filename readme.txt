**For Site Owners**

From any page on the front-end or back-end of your WordPress-powered site, send out an SOS to your webmaster if you run into any trouble.

If you don't have your own webmaster yet, you might consider acquiring one on the official [WordPress jobs board](https://jobs.wordpress.net/).

**For Webmasters/Site Admins/Web Designers/Web Developers**

Add this plugin to client sites to automatically get more details and save time on a lot of back and forth.
